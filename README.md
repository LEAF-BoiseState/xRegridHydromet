# xRegridHydromet

This is an xArray based tool to regrid hydrometeorological datasets from a source grid to a destination grid. It was developed, in particular, to compare forcing datasets created with models like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to other, broadly available datasets.



To-dos to make this a functional package:
- Refactor to enable both command line runs (currently working) and import as a package (TODO)
- Extend tests and create automated testing scripts
- Build set up and installation scripts
- Finalize Travis CI scripts and make sure build passes
- Add codecov 
- Build conda package and submit to conda
- Documentation
-
